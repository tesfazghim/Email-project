This read me is divided into two; first is assumptions about the program I am submitting and second is about the situation and
general information about the project

A) ASSUMPTION:
1. for option 3, first of all the programs assume that there is an inbox to look at
2. also if you try to view an email that doesn't exisit, the program hangs
3. for option 1, if the user enters anything other than 'y' or 'Y' or 'n' or 'N' while asking if user wants to use file or
   enter text for the email, the program hangs; so I assume that the user enters only 'y' or 'Y' or 'n' or 'N'
4. I did test only on localhost and didn't test my programs on the student server lab machines, so fingers crossed on

These are these are the assumptions I made while programming. more like bugs i could fix if I had more time

B) About the late submission:
First of all I want to thank you for giving me a little more extra time to finish the project.
Second of all, the reason there was an issue with encrypting the first batch that was sent is because I had to encrypt everything
my team had done. 
So Josh and Mohammed were responsible for the server and client programs while I was responsible for making the key generator.
Josh and Mohammed decided to make the server and client programs using regular ascii encoding and decoding to pass messages between
the client and the server.

I have time management issues so I presented the key generator a little late but got it working anyways. And while integrating 
the purposes of the key generator and the symmetric key the program got a little complicated and I didn't understand what some parts 
of the program were doing.

The part we handed in through blackboard does not follow parts of the specs e.g, for question 1 the server sent questions to the client.
Yet the specs have cleint just asking the questions. So I had to restart the project and use snips and pieces of our mostly
funcitioning program to build what I am submitting now.

I think the program I am submitting now follow the specs and than our older submission. Hopefully you can use this one instead if it comes up with 
better results.
